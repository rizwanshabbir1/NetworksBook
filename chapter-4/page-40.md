plucked from the Internet about the pain in your chest may have come from a
Nobel Prize winner or from a high-school dropout.
Other information is frequently unwanted. Electronic junk mail (spam) has
become a part of life because spammers have collected millions of email address-
es and would-be marketers can cheaply send computer-generated messages tothem. The resulting flood of spam rivals the flow messages from real people.
Fortunately, filtering software is able to read and discard the spam generated by
other computers, with lesser or greater degrees of success.
Still other content is intended for criminal behavior. Web pages and email
messages containing active content (basically, programs or macros that execute onthe receiver’s machine) can contain viruses that take over your computer. They
might be used to steal your bank account passwords, or to have your computer
send spam as part of a botnet or pool of compromised machines.
Phishing messages masquerade as originating from a trustworthy party, for
example, your bank, to try to trick you into revealing s ensitive information, for
example, credit card numbers. Identity theft is becoming a serious problem as
thieves collect enough information about a victim to obtain credit cards and otherdocuments in the victim’s name.
It can be difficult to prevent computers from impersonating people on the In-
ternet. This problem has led to the development of CAPTCHAs , in which a com-
puter asks a person to solve a short recognition task, for example, typing in the
letters shown in a distorted image, to show that they are human (von Ahn, 2001).This process is a variation on the famous Turing test in which a person asks ques-tions over a network to judge whether the entity responding is human.
A lot of these problems could be solved if the computer industry took com-
puter security seriously. If all messages were encrypted and authenticated, itwould be harder to commit mischief. Such technology is well established and we
will study it in detail in Chap. 8. The problem is that hardware and software ven-dors know that putting in security features costs money and their customers arenot demanding such features. In addition, a substantial number of the problemsare caused by buggy software, which occurs because vendors keep adding more
and more features to their programs, which inevitably means more code and thusmore bugs. A tax on new features might help, but that might be a tough sell insome quarters. A refund for defective software might be nice, except it wouldbankrupt the entire software industry in the first year.
Computer networks raise new legal problems when they interact with old
laws. Electronic gambling provides an example. Computers have been simulatingthings for decades, so why not simulate slot machines, roulette wheels, blackjack
dealers, and more gambling equipment? Well, because it is illegal in a lot of
places. The trouble is, gambling is legal in a lot of other places (England, for ex-
ample) and casino owners there have grasped the potential for Internet gambling.What happens if the gambler, the casino, and the server are all in different coun-tries, with conflicting laws? Good question.
