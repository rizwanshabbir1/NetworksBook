SEC. 1.1 USES OF COMPUTER NETWORKS 9
After the customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use
it, online technical support may be consulted.
Another area in which e-commerce is widely used is access to financial insti-
tutions. Many people already pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and
handle their investments electronically. This trend will surely continue as net-works become more secure.
One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea?).
Online auctions of second-hand goods have become a massive industry. Unliketraditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model, online auctions

TeleVision ) systems that are based on IP technology instead of cable TV or radio
transmissions. Media streaming applications let users tune into Internet radio sta-tions or watch recent episodes of their favorite TV shows. Naturally, all of this
content can be moved around your house between different devices, displays andspeakers, usually with a wireless network.
Soon, it may be possible to search for any movie or television program ever
made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New filmsmay become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story
direction (should Macbeth murder Duncan or just bide his time?) with alternativescenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become interactive,with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and soon.
Another form of entertainment is game playing. Already we have multiperson
