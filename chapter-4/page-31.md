politicians, big fires, scandals involving celebrities, and epidemics, but no foot-
ball, thank you. Sometimes it is possible to have the selected articles downloadedto your computer while you sleep. As this trend continues, it will cause massiveunemployment among 12-year-old paperboys, but newspapers like it because dis-
tribution has always been the weakest link in the whole production chain. Ofcourse, to make this model work, they will first have to figure out how to makemoney in this new world, something not entirely obvious since Internet usersexpect everything to be free.
The next step beyond newspapers (plus magazines and scientific journals) is
the online digital library. Many professional organizations, such as the ACM(www.acm.org ) and the IEEE Computer Society ( www.computer.org ), already
have all their journals and conference proceedings online. Electronic book read-
ers and online libraries may make printed books obsolete. Skeptics should takenote of the effect the printing press had on the medieval illuminated manuscript.
Much of this information is accessed using the client-server model, but there
is different, popular model for accessing information that goes by the name of
peer-to-peer communication (Parameswaran et al., 2001). In this form, individu-
als who form a loose group can communicate with others in the group, as shownin Fig. 1-3. Every person can, in principle, communicate with one or more otherpeople; there is no fixed division into clients and servers.
Figure 1-3. In a peer-to-peer system there are no fixed clients and servers.
Many peer-to-peer systems, such BitTorrent (Cohen, 2003), do not have any
central database of content. Instead, each user maintains his own database locally
and provides a list of other nearby people who are members of the system. A newuser can then go to any existing member to see what he has and get the names ofother members to inspect for more content and more names. This lookup processcan be repeated indefinitely to build up a large local database of what is out there.It is an activity that would get tedious for people but computers excel at it.
