Our last category is ubiquitous computing , in which computing is embedded
into everyday life, as in the vision of Mark Weiser (1991). Many homes are al-ready wired with security systems that include door and window sensors, andthere are many more sensors that can be folded in to a smart home monitor, suchas energy consumption. Your electricity, gas and water meters could also reportusage over the network. This would save money as there would be no need tosend out meter readers. And your smoke detectors could call the fire departmentinstead of making a big noise (which has little value if no one is home). As the
cost of sensing and communication drops, more and more measurement and re-porting will be done with networks.
Increasingly, consumer electronic devices are networked. For example, some
high-end cameras already have a wireless network capability and use it to send
photos to a nearby display for viewing. Professional sports photographers can
also send their photos to their editors in real-time, first wirelessly to an access
point then over the Internet. Devices such as televisions that plug into the wallcan use power-line networks to send information throughout the house over the
wires that carry electricity. It may not be very surprising to have these objects onthe network, but objects that we do not think of as computers may sense and com-municate information too. For example, your shower may record water usage,give you visual feedback while you lather up, and report to a home environmentalmonitoring application when you are done to help save on your water bill.
A technology called RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification ) will push this
idea even further in the future. RFID tags are passive (i.e., have no battery) chipsthe size of stamps and they can already be affixed to books, passports, pets, creditcards, and other items in the home and out. This lets RFID readers locate andcommunicate with the items over a distance of up to several meters, depending onthe kind of RFID. Originally, RFID was commercialized to r eplace barcodes. It
has not succeeded yet because barcodes are free and RFID tags cost a few cents.
Of course, RFID tags offer much more and their price is rapidly declining. Theymay turn the real world into the Internet of things (ITU, 2005).
1.1.3 Mobile Users
Mobile computers, such as laptop and handheld computers, are one of the
fastest-growing segments of the computer industry. Their sales have alreadyovertaken those of desktop computers. Why would anyone want one? People onthe go often want to use their mobile devices to read and send email, tweet, watchmovies, download music, play games, or simply to surf the Web for information.They want to do all of the things they do at home and in the office. Naturally, theywant to do them from anywhere on land, sea or in the air.
