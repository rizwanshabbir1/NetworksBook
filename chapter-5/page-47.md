how to carry both power and data signals at the same time. Part of the answer is
that they use different frequency bands.
In short, home LANs offer many opportunities and challenges. Most of the
latter relate to the need for the networks to be easy to manage, dependable, andsecure, especially in the hands of nontechnical users, as well as low cost.
1.2.3 Metropolitan Area Networks
AMAN (Metropolitan Area Network ) covers a city. The best-known ex-
amples of MANs are the cable television networks available in many cities.
These systems grew from earlier community antenna systems used in areas withpoor over-the-air television reception. In those early systems, a large antenna was
placed on top of a nearby hill and a signal was then piped to the subscribers’
houses.
At first, these were locally designed, ad hoc systems. Then companies began
jumping into the business, getting contracts from local governments to wire up en-
tire cities. The next step was television programming and even entire channels
designed for cable only. Often these channels were highly specialized, such as allnews, all sports, all cooking, all gardening, and so on. But from their inceptionuntil the late 1990s, they were intended for television reception only.
When the Internet began attracting a mass audience, the cable TV network
operators began to realize that with some changes to the system, they could pro-vide two-way Internet service in unused parts of the spectrum. At that point, thecable TV system began to morph from simply a way to distribute television to ametropolitan area network. To a first approximation, a MAN might look some-
thing like the system shown in Fig. 1-9. In this figure we see both television sig-nals and Internet being fed into the centralized cable headend for subsequent dis-
tribution to people’s homes. We will come back to this subject in detail in Chap.2.
Cable television is not the only MAN, though. Recent developments in high-
speed wireless Internet access have resulted in another MAN, which has been
standardized as IEEE 802.16 and is popularly known as WiMAX . We will look
at it in Chap. 4.
1.2.4 Wide Area Networks
AWAN (Wide Area Network ) spans a large geographical area, often a
country or continent. We will begin our discussion with wired WANs, using theexample of a company with branch offices in different cities.
The WAN in Fig. 1-10 is a network that connects offices in Perth, Melbourne,
and Brisbane. Each of these offices contains computers intended for running user(i.e., application) programs. We will follow traditional usage and call these ma-
chines hosts . The rest of the network that connects these hosts is then called the
