that connects networks across space (Burleigh et al., 2003).

In this book we will be concerned with networks at all these scales. In the
following sections, we give a brief introduction to network hardware by scale.
1.2.1 Personal Area Networks
PANs (Personal Area Networks ) let devices communicate over the range of
a person. A common example is a wireless network that connects a computer
with its peripherals. Almost every computer has an attached monitor, keyboard,
mouse, and printer. Without using wireless, this connection must be done with
cables. So many new users have a hard time finding the right cables and pluggingthem into the right little holes (even th ough they are usually color coded) that
most computer vendors offer the option of sending a technician to the userâ€™s hometo do it. To help these users, some companies got together to design a short-rangewireless network called Bluetooth to connect these components without wires.
The idea is that if your devices have Bluetooth, then you need no cables. You justput them down, turn them on, and they work together. For many people, this easeof operation is a big plus.
In the simplest form, Bluetooth networks use the master-slave paradigm of
Fig. 1-7. The system unit (the PC) is normally the master, talking to the mouse,keyboard, etc., as slaves. The master tells the slaves what addresses to use, when
they can broadcast, how long they can transmit, what frequencies they can use,and so on.
Bluetooth can be used in other settings, too. It is often used to connect a
headset to a mobile phone without cords and it can allow your digital music player
