Remote monitoring of the home is a likely winner, as many grown children wouldbe willing to spend some money to help their aging parents live safely in theirown homes.
While we could think of the home network as just another LAN, it is more
likely to have different properties than other networks. First, the networked de-vices have to be very easy to install. Wireless routers are the most returned con-sumer electronic item. People buy one because they want a wireless network at
home, find that it does not work ‘‘out of the box,’’ and then return it rather thanlisten to elevator music while on hold on the technical helpline.
Second, the network and devices have to be foolproof in operation. Air con-
ditioners used to have one knob with four settings: OFF, LOW, MEDIUM, and
HIGH. Now they have 30-page manuals. Once they are networked, expect thechapter on security alone to be 30 pages. This is a problem because only com-
puter users are accustomed to putting up with products that do not work; the car-,
television-, and refrigerator-buying public is far less tolerant. They expect pro-
ducts to work 100% without the need to hire a geek.
Third, low price is essential for success. People will not pay a $50 premium
for an Internet thermostat because few people regard monitoring their home tem-
perature from work that important. For $5 extra, though, it might sell.
Fourth, it must be possible to start out with one or two devices and expand the
reach of the network gradually. This means no format wars. Telling consumers
to buy peripherals with IEEE 1394 (FireWire) interfaces and a few years later
retracting that and saying USB 2.0 is the interface-of-the-month and then switch-
ing that to 802.11g—oops, no, make that 802.11n—I mean 802.16 (different wire-less networks)—is going to make consumers very skittish. The network interface
will have to remain stable for decades, like the television broadcasting standards.
Fifth, security and reliability will be very important. Losing a few files to an
email virus is one thing; having a burglar disarm your security system from hismobile computer and then plunder your house is something quite different.
An interesting question is whether home networks will be wired or wireless.
Convenience and cost favors wireless networking because there are no wires to
fit, or worse, retrofit. Security favors wired networking because the radio waves
that wireless networks use are quite good at going through walls. Not everyone is
overjoyed at the thought of having the neighbors piggybacking on their Internetconnection and reading their email. In Chap. 8 we will study how encryption can
be used to provide security, but it is easier said than done with inexperiencedusers.
A third option that may be appealing is to reuse the networks that are already
in the home. The obvious candidate is the electric wires that are installedthroughout the house. Power-line networks let devices that plug into outlets
broadcast information throughout the house. You have to plug in the TV anyway,and this way it can get Internet connectivity at the same time. The difficulty is
