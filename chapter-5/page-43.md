to connect to your car merely being brought within range. A completely different
kind of PAN is formed when an embedded medical device such as a pacemaker,
insulin pump, or hearing aid talks to a user-operated remote control. We will dis-cuss Bluetooth in more detail in Chap. 4.
PANs can also be built with other technologies that communicate over short
ranges, such as RFID on smartcards and library books. We will study RFID inChap. 4.
1.2.2 Local Area Networks
The next step up is the LAN (Local Area Network ). A LAN is a privately
owned network that operates within and nearby a single building like a home, of-fice or factory. LANs are widely used to connect personal computers and consu-
mer electronics to let them share resources (e.g., printers) and exchange informa-tion. When LANs are used by companies, they are called enterprise networks .
Wireless LANs are very popular these days, especially in homes, older office
buildings, cafeterias, and other places where it is too much trouble to install
cables. In these systems, every computer has a radio modem and an antenna thatit uses to communicate with other computers. In most cases, each computer talks
to a device in the ceiling as shown in Fig. 1-8(a). This device, called an AP
(Access Point ),wireless router ,o r base station , relays packets between the
wireless computers and also between them and the Internet. Being the AP is likebeing the popular kid as school because everyone wants to talk to you. However,
if other computers are close enough, they can communicate directly with one an-other in a peer-to-peer configuration.
There is a standard for wireless LANs called IEEE 802.11 , popularly known
asWiFi , which has become very widespread. It runs at speeds anywhere from 11
