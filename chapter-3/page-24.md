for providing ideas and feedback. Melody Kadenko and Julie Svendsen provided
administrative support to David.
Shivakant Mishra (University of Colorado at Boulder) and Paul Nagin (Chim-
borazo Publishing, Inc.) thought of many new and challenging end-of-chapterproblems. Our editor at Pearson, Tracy Dunkelberger, was her usual helpful self
in many ways large and small. Melinda Haggerty and Jeff Holcomb did a goodjob of keeping things running smoothly. Steve Armstrong (LeTourneau Univer-sity) prepared the PowerPoint slides. Stephen Turner (University of Michigan atFlint) artfully revised the Web resources and the simulators that accompany the
text. Our copyeditor, Rachel Head, is an odd hybrid: she has the eye of an eagle
and the memory of an elephant. After reading all her corrections, both of us won-dered how we ever made it past third grade.
Finally, we come to the most important people. Suzanne has been through
this 19 times now and still has endless patience and love. Barbara and Marvinnow know the difference between good textbooks and bad ones and are always aninspiration to produce good ones. Daniel and Matilde are welcome additions to
our family. Aron is unlikely to read this book soon, but he likes the nice pictureson page 866 (AST). Katrin and Lucy provided endless support and always man-aged to keep a smile on my face. Thank you (DJW).
