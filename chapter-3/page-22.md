xx PREFACE
Chapter 1 has the same introductory function as in the fourth edition, but the
contents have been revised and brought up to date. The Internet, mobile phonenetworks, 802.11, and RFID and sensor networks are discussed as examples ofcomputer networks. Material on the original Ethernet—with its vampire taps—has been removed, along with the material on ATM.
Chapter 2, which covers the physical layer, has expanded coverage of digital
modulation (including OFDM as widely used in wireless networks) and 3G net-
works (based on CDMA). New technologies are discussed, including Fiber to theHome and power-line networking.
Chapter 3, on point-to-point links, has been improved in two ways. The mater-
ial on codes for error detection and correction has been updated, and also includes
a brief description of the modern codes that are important in practice (e.g., convo-lutional and LDPC codes). The examples of protocols now use Packet overSONET and ADSL. Sadly, the material on protocol veriﬁcation has been removedas it is little used.
In Chapter 4, on the MAC sublayer, the principles are timeless but the tech-
nologies have changed. Sections on the example networks have been redone
accordingly, including gigabit Ethernet, 802.11, 802.16, Bluetooth, and RFID.
Also updated is the coverage of LAN switching, including VLANs.
Chapter 5, on the network layer, covers the same ground as in the fourth edi-
tion. The revisions have been to update material and add depth, particularly for
quality of service (relevant for real-time media) and internetworking. The sec-tions on BGP, OSPF and CIDR have been expanded, as has the treatment of
multicast routing. Anycast routing is now included.
Chapter 6, on the transport layer, has had material added, revised, and re-
moved. New material describes delay-tolerant networking and congestion control
in general. The revised material updates and expands the coverage of TCP con-
gestion control. The material removed described connection-oriented network lay-
ers, something rarely seen any more.
Chapter 7, on applications, has also been updated and enlarged. While mater-
ial on DNS and email is similar to that in the fourth edition, in the past few years
there have been many developments in the use of the Web, streaming media andcontent delivery. Accordingly, sections on the Web and streaming media havebeen brought up to date. A new section covers content distribution, includingCDNs and peer-to-peer networks.
Chapter 8, on security, still covers both symmetric and public-key crypto-
graphy for conﬁdentiality and authenticity. Material on the techniques used in
practice, including ﬁrewalls and VPNs, has been updated, with new material on
802.11 security and Kerberos V5 added.
Chapter 9 contains a renewed list of suggested readings and a comprehensive
bibliography of over 300 citations to the current literature. More than half of
these are to papers and boo ks written in 2000 or later, and the rest are citations to
classic papers.
