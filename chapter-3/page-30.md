remote patient monitoring) but may become much more important. It is some-
times said that communication and transportation are having a race, and which-
ever wins will make the other obsolete.
A third goal for many companies is doing business electronically, especially
with customers and suppliers. This new model is called e-commerce (electronic
commerce ) and it has grown rapidly in recent years. Airlines, bookstores, and
other retailers have discovered that many customers like the convenience of shop-
ping from home. Consequently, many companies provide catalogs of their goodsand services online and take orders online. Manufacturers of automobiles, air-craft, and computers, among others, buy subsystems from a variety of suppliersand then assemble the parts. Using computer networks, manufacturers can place
orders electronically as needed. This reduces the need for large inventories andenhances efficiency.
1.1.2 Home Applications
In 1977, Ken Olsen was president of the Digital Equipment Corporation, then
the number two computer vendor in the world (after IBM). When asked why Dig-ital was not going after the personal computer market in a big way, he said:‘‘There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.’’ Historyshowed otherwise and Digital no longer exists. People initially bought computers
for word processing and games. Recently, the biggest reason to buy a home com-
puter was probably for Internet access. Now, many consumer electronic devices,
such as set-top boxes, game consoles, and clock radios, come with embeddedcomputers and computer networks, especially wireless networks, and home net-works are broadly used for entertainment, including listening to, looking at, andcreating music, photos, and videos.
Internet access provides home users with connectivity to remote computers.
As with companies, home users can access information, communicate with other
people, and buy products and services with e-commerce. The main benefit nowcomes from connecting outside of the home. Bob Metcalfe, the inventor of Ether-
net, hypothesized that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the
number of users because this is roughly the number of different connections that
may be made (Gilder, 1993). This hypothesis is known as ‘‘Metcalfe’s law.’’ Ithelps to explain how the tremendous popula rity of the Internet comes from its
size.
Access to remote information comes in many forms. It can be surfing the
World Wide Web for information or just for fun. Information available includesthe arts, business, cooking, government, health, history, hobbies, recreation, sci-
ence, sports, travel, and many others. Fun comes in too many ways to mention,plus some ways that are better left unmentioned.
Many newspapers have gone online and can be personalized. For example, it
is sometimes possible to tell a newspaper that you want everything about corrupt
