computer being the client. Under most conditions, one server can handle a large
number (hundreds or thousands) of clients simultaneously.
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes (i.e.,
running programs) are involved, one on the client machine and one on the servermachine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a messageover the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a replymessage. When the server process gets the request, it performs the requestedwork or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply. These messages areshown in Fig. 1-2.

A second goal of setting up a computer network has to do with people rather
than information or even computers. A computer network can provide a powerfulcommunication medium among employees. Virtually every company that has
two or more computers now has email (electronic mail ), which employees gener-
ally use for a great deal of daily communication. In fact, a common gripe aroundthe water cooler is how much email everyone has to deal with, much of it quite
meaningless because bosses have discovered that they can send the same (often
content-free) message to all their subordinates at the push of a button.
Telephone calls between employees may be carried by the computer network
instead of by the phone company. This technology is called IP telephony or
Voice over IP (VoIP ) when Internet technology is used. The microphone and
speaker at each end may belong to a VoIP-enabled phone or the employeeâ€™s com-
puter. Companies find this a wonderful way to save on their telephone bills.
Other, richer forms of communication are made possible by computer net-
works. Video can be added to audio so that employees at distant locations can seeand hear each other as they hold a meeting. This technique is a powerful tool for
eliminating the cost and time previously devoted to travel. Desktop sharing lets
remote workers see and interact with a graphical computer screen. This makes iteasy for two or more people who work far apart to read and write a shared black-board or write a report together. When one worker makes a change to an onlinedocument, the others can see the change immediately, instead of waiting several
days for a letter. Such a speedup makes cooperation among far-flung groups of
people easy where it previously had been impossible. More ambitious forms of
remote coordination such as telemedicine are only now starting to be used (e.g.,
