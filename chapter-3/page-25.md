INTRODUCTION
Each of the past three centuries was dominated by a single new technology.
The 18th century was the era of the great mechanical systems accompanying the
Industrial Revolution. The 19th century was the age of the steam engine. During
the 20th century, the key technology was information gathering, processing, and
distribution. Among other developments, we saw the installation of worldwidetelephone networks, the invention of radio and television, the birth and unpre-
cedented growth of the computer industry, the launching of communication satel-lites, and, of course, the Internet.
As a result of rapid technological progress, these areas are rapidly converging
in the 21st century and the differences between collecting, transporting, storing,and processing information are quickly disappearing. Organizations with hun-dreds of offices spread over a wide geographical area routinely expect to be ableto examine the current status of even their most remote outpost at the push of abutton. As our ability to gather, process, and distribute information grows, the de-
mand for ever more sophisticated information processing grows even faster.
Although the computer industry is still young compared to other industries
(e.g., automobiles and air transportation), computers have made spectacular pro-gress in a short time. During the first two decades of their existence, computer
systems were highly centralized, usually within a single large room. Not infre-quently, this room had glass walls, through which visitors could gawk at the greatelectronic wonder inside. A medium-sized company or university might have had
