How to Use the Book
To help instructors use this book as a text for courses ranging in length from
quarters to semesters, we have structured the chapters into core and optional ma-terial. The sections marked with a ‘‘*’’ in the table of contents are the optionalones. If a major section (e.g., 2.7) is so marked, all of its subsections are optional.They provide material on network technologies that is useful but can be omitted
from a short course without loss of continuity. Of course, students should beencouraged to read those sections as well, to the extent they have time, as all thematerial is up to date and of value.
