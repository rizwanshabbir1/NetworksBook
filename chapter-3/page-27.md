SEC. 1.1 USES OF COMPUTER NETWORKS 3
Although this book primarily focuses on networks, many of the topics are also im-
portant in distributed systems. For more information about distributed systems,see Tanenbaum and Van Steen (2007).
1.1 USES OF COMPUTER NETWORKS
Before we start to examine the technical issues in detail, it is worth devoting
some time to pointing out why people are interested in computer networks andwhat they can be used for. After all, if nobody were interested in computer net-works, few of them would be built. We will start with traditional uses at com-
panies, then move on to home networking and recent developments regarding
mobile users, and finish with social issues.
1.1.1 Business Applications
Most companies have a substantial number of computers. For example, a
company may have a computer for each worker and use them to design products,
write brochures, and do the payroll. I nitially, some of these computers may have
worked in isolation from the others, but at some point, management may havedecided to connect them to be able to distribute information throughout the com-
pany.
Put in slightly more general form, the issue here is resource sharing . The
goal is to make all programs, equipment, and especially data available to anyoneon the network without regard to the physical location of the resource or the user.
An obvious and widespread example is having a group of office workers share acommon printer. None of the individuals really needs a private printer, and ahigh-volume networked printer is often cheaper, faster, and easier to maintainthan a large collection of individual printers.
However, probably even more important than sharing physical resources such
as printers, and tape backup systems, is sharing information. Companies smalland large are vitally dependent on computerized information. Most companieshave customer records, product information, inventories, financial statements, taxinformation, and much more online. If all of its computers suddenly went down, abank could not last more than five minutes. A modern manufacturing plant, witha computer-controlled assembly line, would not last even 5 seconds. Even a small
travel agency or three-person law firm is now highly dependent on computer net-works for allowing employees to access relevant information and documents
instantly.
For smaller companies, all the computers are likely to be in a single office or
perhaps a single building, but for larger ones, the computers and employees maybe scattered over dozens of offices and plants in many countries. Nevertheless, asales person in New York might sometimes need access to a product inventory
