PREFACE
This book is now in its ﬁfth edition. Each edition has corresponded to a dif-
ferent phase in the way computer networks were used. When the ﬁrst edition ap-peared in 1980, networks were an academic curiosity. When the second edition
appeared in 1988, networks were used by universities and large businesses. When
the third edition appeared in 1996, computer networks, especially the Internet, hadbecome a daily reality for millions of people. By the fourth edition, in 2003, wire-
less networks and mobile computers had become commonplace for accessing the
Web and the Internet. Now, in the ﬁfth edition, networks are about content dis-
tribution (especially videos using CDNs and peer-to-peer networks) and mobilephones are small computers on the Internet.
New in the Fifth Edition
Among the many changes in this book, the most important one is the addition

years ago. He has worked with the Internet and wireless networks ever since andis a professor at the University of Washington, where he has been teaching and
doing research on computer networks and related topics for the past decade.
